# Project Log Template

Copy this file to `logs/<project-id>.md` while you build. Keep it terse and you can paste straight into `projects.json` later.

## Project
- Name / ID:
- Timeframe:
- Links (repo/demo):

## Goal
- What you are trying to ship and why it matters.

## Architecture & Decisions
- Stack choices
- Key trade-offs
- Data model / interface sketch

## Implementation Notes
- Commands run (setup, build, test)
- Gotchas (drivers, versions, env vars)
- Perf notes (benchmarks, profiling output)

## Bugs / Debug Diary
- Issue -> fix -> lesson

## Outcomes
- Impact metrics (perf, accuracy, latency)
- What to highlight on resume / site

## Next Steps
- If you had another day, what would you do?
